    <h1>My Competition Winning Cookies</h1>
    <p>Yes, not to brag, but I am a winner and yes there was a blue ribbon.
        I want to make it clear these are the full bodied recipes and will not be healthy,
        If you are looking for something healthy, <strong>get out</strong>, this is not for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        With that in mind lets get to some baking.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 cup butter <em>softened</em></li>
        <li>1 cup <em>packed</em> light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups butterscotch chips</li>
        <li>2 cups roughly chopped pecans</li>
        <li>2/3 cups of toffee bits</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A note on the toffee: I put mine through a colander to ensure there isnt 
        any powder, but that is just personal preference
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350Â°F</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk and sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set Aside</li>
        <li>Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed cream together the softened butter, light brown sugar, granulated sugar and vanilla extract until fluffy and light beige in color. About 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time beating well after each addition</li>
        <li>Lower the speed of the mixer and gradually add the sifted dry ingredients to the creamed mixture. Stop and scrape the sides of the bowl periodically. After all of the flour has been added beat for 45 seconds to 1 minute to fully incorporate.</li>
        <li>By hand using a large spatula fold in the butterscotch chips, pecan pieces and bits-o-brickle until evenly distributed in the dough.</li>
        <li>Cover and chill for 1 hour</li>
        <li>Use a 1 1/2 tbsp sized ice cream scoop to divide the dough into same sized balls and place on cookie sheets with space in between, so they have room to spread.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, they should be lightly golden brown. This might take seperate batches.</li>
        <li>For an even crunchier bottom, let them cool on pan for 10 minutes, otherwise just cool them for 5 minutes on a cooling rack.</li>
    </ol>
