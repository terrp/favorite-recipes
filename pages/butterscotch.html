    <h1>My Competition Winning Cookies</h1>
    <p>Yes, not to brag, but I am a winner and yes there was a blue ribbon.
        I want to make it clear these are the full bodied recipes and will not be healthy,
        If you are looking for something healthy, <strong>get out</strong>, this is not for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        With that in mind lets get to some baking.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 cup butter <em>softened</em></li>
        <li>1 cup <em>packed</em> light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups butterscotch chips</li>
        <li>2 cups roughly chopped pecans</li>
        <li>2/3 cups of toffee bits</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A note on the toffee: I put mine through a colander to ensure there isnt 
        any powder, but that is just personal preference
